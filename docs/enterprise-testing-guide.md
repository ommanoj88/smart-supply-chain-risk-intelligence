curl http://localhost:8080/mock-apis/enterprise/sap/digital-manufacturing/orders

# Test Oracle ERP API
curl http://localhost:8080/mock-apis/enterprise/oracle/erp/financials/invoices

# Test Weather API
curl "http://localhost:8080/mock-apis/enterprise/weather/forecast?location=Singapore"

# Test Crisis Simulation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mock-apis/enterprise/crisis/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"HURRICANE","severity":4}'
```

### 4. Test Planning APIs:
```bash
# Generate demand forecast
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/planning/demand-forecast \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"materialNumber":"MAT-001","forecastHorizon":12,"algorithm":"ML_ENSEMBLE"}'

# Optimize supply planning
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/planning/supply-optimization \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"materials":["ALL"],"planningHorizon":26,"objective":"COST_MINIMIZATION"}'

# Get planning analytics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/planning/analytics
```

### 5. Test Admin Testing Endpoints:
```bash
# Generate testing scenario
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/testing/generate-scenario \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scenarioType":"HURRICANE_DISRUPTION","intensity":4,"affectedRegions":["Asia","Europe"]}'

# Simulate crisis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/testing/simulate-crisis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"crisisType":"PANDEMIC_CRISIS","duration":72,"realTimeUpdates":true}'

# Generate load test data
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/testing/load-test-data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"suppliers":1000,"shipments":10000,"events":100000}'
```

## Architecture Notes:

The implementation follows the existing patterns:
- **Backend**: Extends existing service layer with new enterprise services
- **Frontend**: Adds new components while reusing existing UI framework
- **Database**: Uses existing entities, minimal schema changes needed
- **Security**: Leverages existing role-based access control
- **APIs**: Follows existing REST API patterns and conventions

This creates a solid foundation for enterprise-grade supply chain management while maintaining compatibility with the existing system.
